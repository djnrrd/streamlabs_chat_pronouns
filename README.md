# streamlabs_chat_pronouns
Custom Javscript for Streamlabs chat overlays that adds pronouns from [alejo.io](https://pronouns.alejo.io/)

## Background

Many people are using the fantastic Twitch chat pronouns service and plugins from [alejo.io](https://pronouns.alejo.io/), but the embedded browser in OBS studio isn't able to load the plugin to have in-video chat render people's pronouns.

Many people use Streamlabs chat overlays in both OBS Studio and Streamlabs OBS, and they provide the ability to load custom Javascript, HTML and CSS to the overlay.
